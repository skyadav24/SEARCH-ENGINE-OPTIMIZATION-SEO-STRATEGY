--As part of my digital marketing internship, I was assigned to develop a comprehensive SEO strategy for a website. This task involved conducting keyword research to identify high-ranking and relevant search terms for the brand. I also focused on optimizing on-page SEO elements, such as meta tags, headings, and content structure, to improve search engine visibility. Additionally, I analyzed backlink-building opportunities to enhance domain authority and implemented technical SEO practices like improving site speed, mobile-friendliness, and indexing. To ensure a structured approach, I prepared a strategic SEO plan document along with a checklist for effective implementation. This strategy aims to boost organic traffic, improve search engine rankings, and increase overall website visibility.
